Before you start writing your program: Read these instructions carefully. A development plan is a process that guides you through solving a problem and creating an algorithm. Download the 2015_AU_softball_SEC.txt data file from the assign10 announcement and save in your COMP1200/assign10 folder. assign10.m will look in the folder where it is saved for the data file. A development plan is a process that guides you through solving a problem and creating an algorithm. Create your own algorithm and use it as comments throughout your program. Use section comments to group your statements as well as comments from your algorithm.
Problem: Program: assign10.c The 2015 Auburn softball team is having a great season. In this assignment, you will read some game result from 2015_AU_softball_SEC.txt and print a report shown below. The season is not over; you do not know how many games are in the file. The following information is in 2015_AU_softball_SEC.txt for each SEC game of the season: 2015 AU Softball SEC Games 14-Mar-2015 Ole_Miss 14 3 5 440 2 7 <= date, opponent, AU runs, opp runs, innings, attendance, hours, minutes 15-Mar-2015 Ole_Miss 7 3 7 200 2 18 16-Mar-2015 Ole_Miss 10 2 6 171 2 25 . . . In assign10.c, you will use two char arrays (date, opponent), a 2D integer array (AU runs, opp runs, innings, attendance) and a double 1D array (game time computed from hours and minutes). Use the following user-defined functions to perform the described tasks. The program structure diagram provides a guide to the relationship of the functions and the information passed to and from the functions. // FUNCTION PROTOTYPES======================================================================== int getFileData ( char title[], char date[][DATE_LEN], char team[][TEAM_LEN], int gameStats[][NUMCOLS], double hours[] ); Function opens and read the data file. If there is an open error, print a message and return to main. Read all data and save specified data in 2D and 1D arrays as described above. Return the number of games read. If there is a file open error, the returned number of games counter will be zero. Use this information in main to determine if the program should be continued. If no games were read, print a message and do not continue the program. void printSummary( char title[], char date[][DATE_LEN], char team[][TEAM_LEN], int gameStats[][NUMCOLS], double hours[], int numGames ); Function uses the data in the arrays and the number of games to print a summary report. See more detained information below. You will also need functions that find and return the average of a column in a 2D integer array and a 1D double array. Problem Constants: FILENAME "2015_AU_softball_SEC.txt" MAXGAMES 25 // estimated number of SEC games in season NUMINNINGS 7 // number of innings in a game NUMCOLS 4 // number of columns in game info array AU_COL 0 // Auburn runs in 1st column of game info array OPP_COL 1 // Opp runs in 2nd column of game info array INN_COL 2 // no. of innings in 3rd column of game info array ATT_COL 3 // attendance in 4th column of game info array MIN_IN_HOUR 60 // number of minutes in an hour TITLE_LEN 27 // title length DATE_LEN 12 // max length of date TEAM_LEN 15 // max length of opp team name Problem Inputs: See above. Problem Outputs: See above. Other variables: As needed. Read all instructions before beginning your work. NOTE: Your submitted file(s) MUST be spelled and cased as instructed.
